ABOUT THE PROGRAM

A simple 2D quiz game, which includes many different topics (i.e. Geography, Economy). This game keeps the score and purchase data in PlayFab, so leaderboards are basically received from PlayFab. It's quite minimalistic, but the questions get a lot harder, so in the end you go learn a lot new stuff. If some of the questions are too hard, you can explode the wrong answers with coins, which can be gained either by purchase or watching ads.
